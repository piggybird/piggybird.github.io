# Secret Library #

## The main logic ##

The target is a 64-bit ELF file. Since its logic is quite simple I won't explain in details the assembly code.
Here's the pseudo code of the main communication:

```c
special_input = 0;              // stored at 0x603394
char input_buffer[9];
char file_name[9];

while (true) {
    input = read_user_input();  // Read user input into input_buffer and
                                // return the number represented by input_buffer as hex string
                                // Only '0'-'9', 'A'-'F' are accepted.
    switch (input) {
    case 0x952A7224:
        if (special_input == 0x278F03): {
            display("sure! the head librarian ...\n");
            display_current_dir();          // Display content of current directory
        }
        break;
    case 0xF1140B88:
        display("you want me to show you a book?....\n");
        file_name[0] = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
            if (read_user_input() & 1)
                strcat(file_name, input_buffer);
            else: {
                display("pah! we don't have books ....\n");
                break;
            }
        }
        display_file_content(file_name);
        break;
    case 0xF39ED0C:
        convert_bin_to_hex();
        break;
    case 0x420B65F7:
        display("alright, show me your library card.\n");
        special_input = read_user_input();
        if (special_input == 0x278F03) {
            display("oh, you say you're the head librarian? prove it!\n");
            // Here's is the guessing game
            // we have 10 tries to guess the random number from "/dev/urandom"
            if (failed_to_guess)
                special_input = 0;
        }
        display("alright!\n");
    }
}
```

So here are the steps we should follow to get the flag:

* Enter "**420B65F7**", the program responses: "**alright, show me your library card.**"
* Enter "**00278F03**", the program responses: "**oh, you say you're the head librarian? prove it!**"
* Playing the guessing game and win the game to ensure that **special_input == 0x278F03**
* Enter "**952A7224**", then the program will tell us the content of the current directory and of course the name of the flag file which contains hopefully only hex characters.
* Enter "**F1140B88**", the program response: "**you want me to show you a book? ...**", then we enter the flag file name twice as hex string, then we have a flag.

But how can we win the guessing game? Well I may say it's *impossible*!

## rt_sigprocmask ##
The trick here is the function at **0x400AF6** that converts an 8-bit hex character into the number it represents:

```c
int hex_char_to_number(char ch) {
    if (ch < '0')
        return -1;
    if (ch <= '9')
        return (ch - '0');  // '0' -> '9'
    if (ch < 'A') {
        // Tricky
        //ch = [0x3A - 0x40]
        rt_sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, NULL, (sigset_t*)0x603397, sizeof(sigset_t));
    } else if (ch <= 'F')
        return (ch - 'A' + 10); // 'A' -> 'F'
    else
        return -1;
}
```

If we enter any character in range from 0x3A (':') to 0x40 ('@') the program will call **rt_sigprocmask** to return the current blocked signals to offset **0x603397**. Since there is usually no blocked signal, the 8 bytes starting at **0x603397** will be zero-filled.

The interesting part is the **special_input** variable which is stored at **0x603394**. Since this ELF is little-endian, the **rt_sigprocmask** call will overwrite the most significant byte of **special_input** and set it to zero.

## Solution ##
So here's how we should enter to get the flag:

* Enter "**420B65F7**", the program responses: "**alright, show me your library card.**".
* Enter "**XY278F03**", where **XY** could be any two hex characters ('0'-'F','A'-'9') except "00". The program responses: "**alright!**" and set the value of **special_input** to **XY278F03**.
* Enter a string that contains at least one character in range 0x3A-0x40 to trigger the **rt_sigprocmask**. The most significant byte of **special_input** will be set to zero. This means that **secial_input == 0x00278F03**
* Enter "**952A7224**", then the program will show us the name of the flag file.
* Enter "**F1140B88**", then enter two hex strings representing the name of the flag file to get the flag.

Here's our example input while connecting to **school.fluxfingers.net:1527**:

* **420B65F7**
* **12278F03**
* **12278F0@**
* **952A7224**

And we have the following responses from server:


<pre>hi! this is the secret library. if you want me to speak to you, you need to know the magic words.
alright, show me your library card.
alright!
warning: invalid hexchar '@'
you do know the magic words, right?
sure! the head librarian is allowed to know about all the books!
------------
16F7F4D391F030CF
------------</pre>

Then we know the flag file name is "16F7F4D391F030CF". We connect to **school.fluxfingers.net:1527** again and enter the following sequences:

* **F1140B88**
* **16F7F4D3**
* **91F030CF**

Here's how the server responses:

<pre>hi! this is the secret library. if you want me to speak to you, you need to know the magic words.
you want me to show you a book? certainly! just tell me the name of the book.
oh, yes, we have that! here you go...
flag{our_secret_is_that_we_really_just_have_this_one_book}

====================</pre>


So the flag is **flag{our_secret_is_that_we_really_just_have_this_one_book}**
